      Whitewater Rafting

In my free time, I enjoy going whitewater rafting. I have been rafting in multiple states! 
Including Georgia, Pennsylvannia, Georgia, Virginia, and Alaska. Unfortunately, rafting is
seasonal or I'd be doing this all year long. Evemtually, I want to go on a month long rafting 
trip to the Grand Canyon next season!

Also, I enjoy playing video games in my spare time! I enjoy playing games like Diablo 4, Destiny 2,
The Finals, and Apex Legends. At a time I would play competitively but nowadays I am more of a casual
gamer.
